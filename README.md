# WSU Data 115 Personal Dataset Project

This repo contains the analysis for my WSU Data 115 "Personal Dataset Project". In this project, I'll use statistical analysis - leveraging Excel and R - to address the following types of questions:

**Note:** References to gender and sexual identity are based on the values supplied by the individual participants of the surveys on which my analysis is based.

- What is the pay difference between men and women?
- What are the differences in overtime needed between software developers in the U.S. vs. the rest of the world, and between men and women?
- How does LGBTQ+ representation in software developers compare to the general public?
- How does job satisfaction compare between software developers pros in the U.S. vs. the rest of the world, and between men and women?
